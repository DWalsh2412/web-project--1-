    <h2>Legendary lords</h2>
        We will be going over the legendary lords of each faction telling you about there lore and playstyle.
    </article>
        
        <h3>High Elves</h3>
        <h4>TYRION:
        Among the High Elves the names of Tyrion and Teclis are spoken with hushed respect. The fame of those twin brothers extends throughout Ulthuan and into the lands beyond. Born into one of the oldest families of Ulthuan, the brothers can trace their line back to the doomed Aenarion, first and mightiest of the Phoenix Kings of Ulthuan. It is their destiny to perform mighty deeds and shape the fate of kingdoms. Prince Tyrion is the High Elves' greatest living warrior. So valiant and skilled is he that the bards of Ulthuan sing that he is nothing less than Aenarion reborn - a tale that is given credence far beyond Ulthuan's shores. Since Tyrion's meteoric rise to fame, many have whispered of his destiny to lead the High Elves towards a glorious future, and perhaps one day to take the Phoenix Crown. If Tyrion hears such gossip, he pays it no heed, for he is unswervingly loyal to Finubar. Thus does Tyrion concern himself only with the twin duties of protecting Ulthuan and its Everqueen. However, the latter is seen less as a duty than it is a calling of the heart - it is common knowledge that Tyrion is Alarielle's consort, and has been for many years.
        PLAYSTYLE:
        Tyrion is one of the best Duelist Lords in the game with his high melee stats, armor, leadership and damage. Additionally, when mounted on Malhandir, he can easily catch up with any enemy Lords (except if they have a flying mount, of course). Pointing him in the direction of the enemy General or a troublesome Hero and letting him go to town on them is always a good plan. While he can just as well fight enemy infantry or cavalry when there is no better target, his skills are wasted on them seeing as he doesn´t have much area of effect-damage apart from Sunfang´s special ability.
        FACTION EFFECTS:
        Diplomatic Relations: +20 with High Elves
        Construction Time: -50% for Shrine of Khaine building
        Recruitment Duration: -1 turn for infantry and cavalry units (minimum 1)
        LORD EFFECTS:
        Upkeep -50% for Spearmen, Silverin Guard, Rangers, Archers and Silver Helms units (lord's army)
        +3 recruit rank for Lothern Sea Guard units
        </h4>
        <h4>TECLIS:
         Teclis is Tyrion's twin brother, but two more different siblings would be hard to find. Where the curse of Aenarion has yet to leave an obvious mark upon Tyrion, it has made his brother frail and caustic. Indeed, so feeble is Teclis that his body can only be sustained by the consumption of magical potions. Yet no-one, least of all Tyrion, sees Teclis as the weaker twin - his destiny merely lies along another path. Teclis has been blessed with a talent for magic that makes him preeminent, not only amongst the mages of Ulthuan, but in the whole world. Though it is little acknowledged in Naggaroth, the Witch King accedes that Teclis is his superior and, since the Battle of Finuval Plain, has taken care not to come into direct conflict with his younger cousin. It is even claimed that Teclis' approaches that of the great Necromancer Nagash, so it is fortunate that he has devoted his life to thwarting the powers of Chaos and death.
        PLAYSTYLE:
        Teclis is one of the strongest mages in in the game only beaten by gen1 slains which teclis can beat in melee with the help of his arcane Pheonix. Teclis has access to multiple class's of magic being offense crowd control, single entity damage spells or buff,Debuff spells.
        FACTION EFFECTS:
        Diplomatic relations: +10 with Men, High Elves, Wood Elves, Lizardmen and Dwarfs
        Construction cost: -25% for Mage buildings
        Recruitment rank: +5 for Loremasters of Hoeth, Mages and Archmages
        Recruitment cost: -25% for Swordmaster of Hoeth and Phoenix units
        LORD EFFECTS:
        Winds of Magic power reserve: +30
        Bound spell: Fireball (see above)        
        </h4>
        <h4>ALARIELLE THE RADIENT:
        Alarielle is the Everqueen of Ulthuan, the spiritual leader and mother-figure of her people. She is seen as blessed of Isha, the mother goddess, and looked upon for protection and guidance by the High Elves. She also rules over the High Elf kingdom of Avelorn and holds court there. Since the Golden Age, the Everqueen has served as Isha's chosen priestess in the mortal world. Whilst the tradition of the Phoenix King is relatively new, a mere six and a half thousand years in age, there has always been an Everqueen.
        PLAYSTYLE:
        Alarielle is a versatile spellcaster, bringing extreme amounts of healing and augment magic while also having some offensive capabilities. She is also surprisingly durable in melee, as her melee defence is higher than one would expect. She can also be given a Great Eagle mount to provide mobility and the ability to charge an enemy quickly and run before being tied down in melee.
        FACTION EFFECTS:
        Alarielle has access to unique forest spirts which are great at holding the line.
        LORD EFFECTS:
        Alarielle leaves lingering bonuses on provinces she visits.
        Alarielle weakens as Chaos grows stronger.
        Missile damage +15% for Sisters of Avelorn and Handmaidens (lord's army).
        </h4> 
        <h4>ALITH ANAR:
        Tradition maintains that the folk of Nagarythe chose Alith Anar as ruler after Malekith fled into the west. The Lord was the last heir of a great line, his forebears slain by the Witch King’s minions. In the following dark days there were many Druchii still hiding in Ulthuan, so Anar took to their eradication. Those not slain in battle were crucified upon trees - grisly monuments to the vengeance of Nagarythe’s Shadow King. He became a revenant who sought the death of every traitor-kin who dared live in the Sundering’s wake. Even now, thousands of years later, the Shadow King still hunts, and will not rest his bow until Malekith’s death.
        PLAYSTYLE:
        The premiere ranged Legendary Lord, Alith Anar is capable of taking out enemy Lords long before they even get to melee range. His range is massive at 300, which is comparable to artillery range. While he can do decently against lower tier enemies in melee, Alith should almost always be sniping enemies and moving, as it is where he shines. His move speed is 46 which is quite high for infantry, but any cavalry will be able to catch him easily. When upgraded in campaign, he can be almost impossible to pin down, with fast speed, infinite vigour and the ability to make doubles capable of harming the enemy.
        FACTION EFFECTS:
        gets bonus's from assainnating key lords
        LORD EFFECTS:
        Upkeep -50% for Shadow-walkers units.
        Ambush success chance +25%

        </h4>

        
        <H3>Dark Elves</H3>
        <H4>MALEKITH:
        Malekith is the son of Morathi and the late Aenarion, the very first Phœnix King. Before his betrayal and assassination of Bel Shanaar, the second Phœnix King, he also was known as Malekith the Great. Malekith has done much and risked much more to achieve dominion; he will do more still. The Witch King is the supreme ruler of Naggaroth, and the eternal enemy of the High Elves. Long ago, he sought the claim Ulthuan's crown, but the Flames of Asuryan left him scarred by fire and twisted with hatred. In the years since, Malekith has many times attempted to scour Ulthuan from the face of the world, but each time has been undone by cruel fate or the incompetence of craven underlings. Yet the Witch King is immortal, and knows he will outlast those who foolishly believe themselves his betters. The day is fast approaching where old debts and insults will finally be repaid, and Malekith will do anything within his power to hasten its arrival.
        PLAYSTYLE:
        Malekith is a powerful swordsman and lore of dark spellcaster. He skills can be allocated to specialize in either class or towards a balanced build. Choosing Seraphon as his mount makes him mobile and durable while enabling him to br much more effective in damaging groups of enemies in melee combat.
        FACTION EFFECTS:
        Malekith gives a percentage of his XP earned to other Lords
        Diplomatic relations +30 with Cult of Pleasure
        loyalty +2 for newly recruited Lords
        Increased chance of loyalty loss for Lords of a higher rank than Malekith
        LORD EFFECTS:
        Upkeep -50% for Black Guard of Naggarond, Dreadspears, Bleakswords and Darkshards units (Lord's army) - this is through his personal character trait
        </H4>
        <h4>MORATHI:
        Morathi the Hag Sorceress of Ghrond and First of the Hag Queens is the mother of Malekith and one-time consort of Aenarion, who rescued her from a warband of Slaanesh in the days of the first Chaos invasion, before the Sundering. She is not only the lone Witch Elf allowed to use Dark Magic but is also one of the most powerful magic-users in the world, rivalling perhaps even Nagash the Great Necromancer, the Lords of Change, and Teclis of Ulthuan. She has struck Daemonic pacts with many vile and disturbing forces, and can unleash the terrible power of Chaos upon those who displease her. Morathi's entire existence has been one of scheming and manipulation. 
        PLAYSTYLE:
        Morathi is a fast anti large lord with access to lore of death which is extremly powerful.
        FACTION EFFECTS:
         Spreads Chaos corruption
         +20 Diplomatic relations with Dark Elves
         -50% Hero action cost
        LORD EFFECTS:
         On turn start, Lords in this character's region have a chance to gain 2 loyalty (local region).
         Chaos corruption +1 (all characters)
        </h4>
        <h4>CRONE HELLEBRON
        Greatest of all the Brides of Khaine, the many ways of murder are Hellebron's to command. Crone Hellebron is the Hag-Queen, the Blood-Queen of Har Ganeth. She is also a most prominent member of the murderous Cult of Khaine, elven god of war and killing. Hellebron is ancient, even by elven standards, but has been denied the secret of eternal youth by Morathi. Therefore she must sacrifice ever increasing amounts of slaves to maintain her youth for an ever shorter time. For this reason there is a deep hatred between Morathi and Hellebron.
        PLAYSTYLE:
        The Crone is an effective melee combatant that is essentially a buffed up Death Hag. She excels at dealing damage, making allies stronger, and enemies weaker. She is also able to get a Cauldron of Blood mount as well as a manticore, which allows her to fly and cause fear/terror. She has high armour piercing damage and an innate bonus vs. infantry which allows her to shred most infantry with ease.
        FACTION EFFECTS:
        Hero capacity: +2 for Death Hags
        Casualties captured post-battle: +25%
        LORD EFFECTS:
        -50% upkeep for Witch Elves, Sisters of Slaughter and Har Ganeth Executioners (Lord's army).
        +10% Weapon Strength to Witch Elves, Sisters of Slaughter, and Har Ganeth Executioners (Lord's army).
        </h4>
        <h4>MALUS DARKBLADE
        Malus Darkblade, known as the "Tyrant of Hag Graef," is the current Drachau or ruler of the Dark Elf city of Hag Graef and a powerful warlord and favoured servant of the Witch King Malekith.Malus Darkblade was always ambitious, even by the lofty standards of Hag Graef's warring families. For long years, he played the Dark Elves' deadly game of politics and assassination and played it well, but finally his thirst for power led Darkblade into the clutches of a being darker even than he. Rumours of a great power hidden in the distant north set Darkblade on a quest that led him deep into the Chaos Wastes.It is a testament to Darkblade's determination that he not only survived his journey but at last came before the temple of Kul Hadar, in which his prize could be found. Alas for Darkblade, the great power within the temple was something not easily bent to mortal will.Long centuries ago, the Greater Daemon of Slaanesh Tz'arkan had been bound within Kul Hadar, and Darkblade now unwittingly presented it an opportunity for escape. Blinded by avarice, Darkblade was possessed by the Daemon. In that instant, his life and soul were forfeit.
        PLAYSTYLE:
        Malus is a very unique lord with the ability to transform, giving him full health and new abilities, at the cost of slowly losing health over time. Malus by himself is a proficient duelist lord. On his mount he provides a strong amount of armour piercing damage while being mobile. He is useful for riding with other cavalry units or paired with some supporting elements to protect him if he gets surrounded. Should your enemy focus him, resist popping his transformation until the last possible moment. Once you do, Malus has a timer on his health that will expire. Many enemies will force the transformation then kite Tz'arkan until he falls and then reengage. Use Tz'arkan's abilities effectively, one of them steals health from nearby enemies and gives it to him which can help Tz'arkan last a bit longer. It is a good idea to bring one or two extra mobile units that can hunt enemies down and stop them from kiting Tz'arkan.
        FACTION EFFECTS
        Malus is possessed by the daemon Tz’arkan, who is controlled with the use of elixirs
        Tz’arkan’s Whispers: The Daemon influences Malus to commit acts of slaughter and cruelty
        Military Alliance with Naggarond
        Income from Irons Mines, Gold Mines and Marble Quarries +30% (All Regions)
        LORD EFFECTS:
        Can transform into the demon tz'arkan which is extremely powerfull but slowly kills malus.

        </h4>
        <h3>SKAVEN</h3>
        <h4>QUEEK HEADTAKER:
        Warlord Queek Headtaker is Right Claw to Warlord Gnawdwell, grand ruler of Clan Mors and member of the Council of Thirteen. That Queek has risen so high in arguably the most powerful Warlord clan is a credit to the terrible violence he unleashed on any in his way. Queek's vicious streak and vitriolic temper, along with his immense ego, are legendary amongst Skaven, who regard such traits as greatly admirable. Although his scarlet-armoured Stormvermin often accompany him, Warlord Queek takes pleasure in personally dispatching enemy leaders. In his arrogance, he carries the severed heads of his latest opponents on a trophy rack to remind followers - and Warlord Gnawdwell - of the fighting prowess of the almighty Warlord Queek, the Headtaker, the Dwarf-smiter. Adorned upon spikes in Queek's collection are Krug Ironhand, Ikit Slash of Fester Spike, and the hands of Baron Albrecht Kraus of Averland.
        PLAYSTYLE:
        Queek is well suited to taking out enemy Lords and Heroes in melee, especially if you spend enough points in his combat skill tree to unlock Trophy Heads, giving him a very powerful debuff to use against them. However he suffers from the same problem that all Lords without mounts invariably have: because he has low mass and speed, he can easily be bogged down by blocks of enemy infantry and not reach his desired targets in time. His Verminous Valor skill alleviates this somewhat and can free him if he gets surrounded, but since it is on a 45 second cooldown timer it can only be used infrequently.
        FACTION EFFECTS:
        Queek Headtaker steals a percentage of EXP earned by other Lords
        Loyalty: -2 for Grey Seer recruits
        +2 Hero capacity for Chieftain
        LORD EFFECTS:
        Melee attack: +10 when fighting against Dwarfs and Greenskin Tribes
        Weapon strength: +10% when fighting against Dwarfs and Greenskin Tribes
        Upkeep: -50% for Stormvermin and Clanrat units (Lord's army)
        Army ability number of uses: +2 for "The Menace Below"
        </h4>
        <h4>LORD SKROLK:      
        That Lord Skrolk walks the world is an affront to nature and a sign of the power of the Great Horned Rat. Plants wither and die where Skrolk treads and the very air about him seems to congeal and darken, as if stained by his baleful presence. Skrolk is ancient, having existed many spans of even the most long-lived of his foul kind. Rather than weakening with age, he is possessed of a diabolic vitality that belies the years and the heaped diseases he carries. Indeed, he is bent and gnarled under the weight of countless corruptions. The flesh that is not hidden by his tattered shroud is leathery and covered in a layer of dripping buboes. Even worse, the mysterious hunching growths framed by the robes promise something still more virulent. Each new pox only toughens the aged Plague Monk, who has himself become a walking disease.
        PLAYSTYLE:
        SKROLK has access to an upgraded lore of plage which gives him an upgraded summons and increased damage. skrolk has access to a chariot  which is great against infantry.
        FACTION EFFECT:
        Chance of a plague spreading: +100%
        Plagues bolster your forces and nurture your settlements
        Construction cost: -50% for Pox Cauldron, Pestilent Nave, and Plague Abbey buildings
        LORD EFFECTS:
        Plague Lord: +3 Skaven corruption in local province as a lord effect
        -50% upkeep for Plague Monks, Plague Monk Censer Bearers, Plagueclaw Catapult, and Plague Priest units
        </h4>
        <H4>TRETCH CRAVENTAIL:
        Tretch began his rise from anonymity when his Clawpack was leading a long line of Night Goblins back to Crookback Mountain. Ostensibly, the Clawleader had chosen Tretch to carry key items of the scavenged loot as a reward for his idea to spike the Goblins' fungus beer, but it is more likely he was chosen because he was deemed too scrawny to usurp the Clawpack. This proved untrue, as Tretch used a small keg of distilled Mad Cap mushrooms, the stuff that turns Goblins into deranged, spinning lunatics, to great effect. With impeccable timing, Tretch turned his line of slaves into whirling death-dealers just as the Clawleaders and Chieftains were convening to argue over which tunnel to take. The effect of multiple Fanatics chained to each other and attempting to twirl madly in a packed tunnel was spectacularly bloody.
        PLAYSTYLE:
        With his unique skills, the buffs from his Lucky Skullhelm and the regular Ancient Cunning skill, Tretch gains a whopping 65% extra ambush success chance. Since his army also gets a +13 melee attack bonus when ambushing and Skaven can ambush enemies offensively without needing to wait for them to wander into a prepared control zone, he is pretty much the king of sneak attacks. On the campaign map this allows him to pick apart enemy forces bigger than a single army one after another without having to worry about reinforcements; a very useful ability for dealing with the stacks spawned by Vortex rituals. In battle his most useful asset is his immense resistance to damage via regeneration, very high melee defence, the Lucky Skullhelm as well as his Stay Here, I´ll Get Help ability letting him turn invisible to slip away. Although he will probably not earn a lot of kills on his own, he can be used to distract and block enemy units that would do more damage elsewhere while you hit them with missile fire or attack them from behind. His Tretch´s Raiders aura can also be used to bolster your frontline with extra melee attack and weapon damage.
        FACTION EFFECTS:
        Scurry Away! has improved effect and grants a minor ward save when active
        Public order +4 when a diplomatic treaty is broken
        Attribute: Encourage for Stormvermin units
        Recruit rank +3 for Stormvermin units
        LORD EFFECTS:
        Attribute: Vanguard deployment (Tretch's army)
        Melee attack +13 during ambush battles (Tretch's army)
        Melee attack +13 after retreating when attacked (Tretch's army)
        </H4>
        <h4>ikit Claw:
        Ikit Claw – like all of Skavenkind – is naturally suspicious, untrusting, untrustworthy and treacherous. His aptitude for science and invention is unrivalled, but as well as being the greatest Skaven Warlock Engineer of all time, Ikit Claw has also developed an awesome command of the Winds of Magic. His exceptional scientific knowledge and magical powers have made him indispensable to the Council of Thirteen.
        PLAYSTYLE:
        Objectively speaking Ikit is the most powerful Skaven Legendary Lord in campaign currently.This is due to the fact that he is the only one of the four available Lords who gets a personal mount (Doomflayer or Doomwheel) as well as his faction´s unique Forbidden Workshop mechanic. The sheer multitude of upgrades and items he can get to improve his weapon teams and war machines with is massive, not to mention he also has access to extra Regiments of Renown and the devastating Doomrocket. Since he comes with an upkeep reduction of 50% for weapon teams, his army should be focused on heavy ranged attacks and war machines.
        FACTION EFFECT:
        Access to the Forbidden Workshop
        Research rate +20%
        Loyalty +2 for newly recruited characters
        Construction cost -40% for Engineering branch Skaven buildings
        LORD EFFECTS:
        Starts the campaign with a Warpstorm Doomrocket
        Upkeep: -50% for Warplock Jezzails, Ratling Gun Weapons Team and Warpfire Thrower Weapons Team (Lord's army)
        Recruit rank: +2 for all Skaven Weapon Team units

</h4>
        <h3>Lizardmen</h3>
        <h4>Lord Mazdamundi
        Lord Mazdamundi is the oldest and arguably most powerful of the living Slann Mage-Priests. At the Dawn of Creation he was instructed by none other than Lord Kroak himself. With a matchless mind unfathomable to others, Mazdamundi is obstinate in his way and will not be deterred from that upon which he has decided. Although it took many interruptions to his thoughtful contemplations, at last the great Slann has fully bestirred himself, shaking off the lethargy that has afflicted so many of his kind. In the last few centuries he has become the most proactive of all the Mage-Priests. When riled, the Lord of the Sun City will levitate his palanquin-throne atop the largest Stegadon that can be found. The current beast, a colossal specimen name Zlaaq, has served Mazdamundi for almost five hundred years. Once aloft on his mount, Mazdamundi will march out at the head of the armies of Hexoatl. With a flick of his wrist, Mazdamundi has smashed cities and doomed armies. His Great Purpose does not allow for mercy. With singular determination, Mazdamundi will enact the Great Plan - the complete extermination of the unfit races
        PLAYSTYLE:
        As is typical of all Slann mage priests in the game, Lord Mazdamundi is not in the best of shapes right at campaign start, but properly trained and leveled up is one of the most versatile, deadly and enduring spellcasters there are. Starting out with just a basic healing spell (Apotheosis) and without his signature mount, Zlaaq, he must be carefully protected in the early game and used mainly as a supporting caster and to bolster your frontline with his Encourage ability. Once he has unlocked his regeneration ability, Zlaaq and the poisonous Cobra Mace, he can be used like a spellcasting Stegadon; throwing him right into the melee with your frontline will no longer be a problem. If you also level up all his resistance traits from his unique and Slann skill trees, he becomes a charging, spell-slinging, poison-inducing, regenerating living fortress that can easily tank half an enemy army´s damage output and tear them to shreds with his Banishment, Comet of Cassandora and Ruination of Cities while your army mops up the rest.
        FACTION EFFCTS:
        Diplomatic relations: -10 with most factions
        Construction cost: -50% for Star Chamber building
        Rites cost: -30%
        Slann Mage-Priest lord capacity: +1
        LORD EFFECTS:
        Miscast base chance: -50%
        Unit experience gain per turn: +50 (Lord's army)
        Upkeep: -50% for Temple Guards units (Lord's army)
        Winds of Magic power reserve: +40
        </h4>
        <h4>Kroq-Gar
        Kroq-Gar is an ancient spawning, one of the original Saurus and destined for greatness since birth. He was spawned in the now ruined Temple-City of Xhotl. He possesses a natural ability to tame the wild beasts of Lustria and bind them to his will, as well as an unmatched martial prowess and understanding of strategy. After his spawning, he claimed Grymloq, the greatest and wildest Carnosaur of a recent brood, as his mount.
        PLAYSTYLE:
        Kroq-Gar is one of the best Melee Lords, able to slay both enemy characters and units with ease. When mounted upon Grymloq he gains a massive Bonus vs. Large, allowing him to challenge monsters and cavalry. He is a lot more reliable in battle, since his mount Grymloq will never rampage. Kroq-Gar can use the Cold-Blooded ability to keep other rampaging units in the fight longer. In battle, Kroq-Gar is best used to hunt down the biggest and most dangerous targets. He can use his Hand of the Gods to punish blobs of Units, shooting magic missiles at them.
        FACTION EFFECTS:
        Upkeep -10% (all units)
        LORD EFFECTS:
        Leadership +10 (lord's army)
        Upkeep -50% for Saurus and Cold One units (lord's army)
        Leadership +10 for Stegadon, Terradon, Bastiladon and Carnosaur units (lord's army)
        Armour +10 for Stegadon, Terradon, Bastiladon and Carnosaur units (lord's army)
        Ambush success chance +25% (lord's army)
        </h4>
        <h4>GOR-ROK:
        Nicknamed The Great White Lizard, Gor-Rok was born with extraordinary proportions (even for a saurus) and albine colour of skin. For that, he was destined to be an outstanding leader a deadly combatant and overall a true hero since his birth. When Gor-Rok first emerged from the spawning pool of Itza, his size, pure albino colourings and lone arrival immediately marked him as a future champion. And so it has been — for the Great White Lizard, as Gor-Rok is also known, has fought in countless battles, his heavily scarred body a testament to many thousands of hard-fought triumphs. Gor-Rok is the mightiest of warriors, the solid centre around which the Saurus battle lines advance, and the rock on which Itza’s enemies are broken.
        PLAYSTYLE:
        Gor-Rok is a tank through and through. He is strong and very defensible. He may not win a battle on his own, but he will outlast hordes of enemies or the targeting of powerful character units. He is meant to be the ultimate defender of the Lizardmen, which is translated in game to bonuses when he is in friendly territory or when under siege. One can think of a Gor-Rok campaign as a slow moving but inevitable wave. Once you take an enemy settlement, as long as Gor-Rok is there the settlement shouldn't fall. His bonuses incentivize a focus on fully securing his lands before pressing forward to conquer more, although with Lord Kroak, its easy to crush one's enemies regardless of where they are.

        Begins the campaign with access to Lord Kroak
        Rite of Resilience: unbreakable and defence for Saurus

        <h4>TEHENHAUIN:
        Tehenhauin, a Red Crested Skink, emerged as the charismatic Prophet of Sotek after a devastating plague was spread across Lustria by Clan Pestilens. As he led a migration out of the defiled city of Chaqua where the disease began, he prophesised the coming of the Serpent-God and rallied the surviving population of Lizardmen to join his counterattack. As Sotek’s cult grew, so too did the Prophet’s following, and for many years Tehenhauin led his apostles to many victories, slaughtering countless captives as sacrificial offerings in the hope that their spilt blood would bring forth the Serpent-God himself.
        PLAYSTYLE:
        Tehehauin is a versatile fighter that is capable in melee, but also has access to magic. His mounts, particularly the ancient stegadon turn him into a strong fighter all while retaining magic casting abilities.
        FACTION EFFECTS:
        Cost -75% for the Rite of Sotek
        Upkeep +200% for Saurus infantry units and Temple Guard, until reaching stage 2 of the Prophecy of Sotek.
        LORD EFFECTS:
        Physical resistance +10% for Skinks units (Lord's army)
